# Code of Conduct

We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of our community, regardless of their background or identity. To that end, we have established the following code of conduct, which all contributors and participants in our community are expected to abide by.

1. Be respectful and considerate of others. We will not tolerate any form of harassment, discrimination, or bullying, online or offline.

2. We will not tolerate hate speech or discrimination based on any of the following characteristics: age, disability, gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or sexual orientation.

3. We are committed to providing a safe and productive environment for everyone. We will not tolerate any behavior that is disruptive to the work of others or that makes people feel uncomfortable.

4. Maintain a safe space. Reporting any violations of our code of conduct to a member of the project team or to one of our designated liaisons will not result in retaliation.

5. Be mindful of the tone you use when communicating with others. Be patient and kind, and avoid sarcasm, irony, and other forms of humor that may be misinterpreted.

6. Be aware of the fact that people come from a variety of backgrounds and may have different perspectives on issues. We encourage respectful and constructive disagreement and welcome the opportunity to learn from one another.

7. We reserve the right to remove any content or participation that does not comply with these guidelines. Repeat offenders may be banned from the community at the discretion of the project team.

If you have any questions about this code of conduct or if you believe that someone is in violation of it, please reach out to a member of the project team or to one of our designated liaisons.
