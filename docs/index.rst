Welcome to the BEAST Documentaion!
==================================

BEAST (Binary Evolution And Sentience Toolkit) is an open source project `hosted on GitHub
<https://github.com/dedicate-project/beast>`_. This documentation has a three-fold intention:

1. Give an overview of what the project is about and motivate its ideas and architecture

2. Expose the public :ref:`API` that developers can use to incorporate BEAST into their own
   ecosystem and applications. This includes a list of the available :ref:`Operators`.

3. Explain, by examples, how to achieve specific results with BEAST, and give some representative
   use-cases. Explore potential :ref:`Real World Applications`.

Project Synopsis
----------------

BEAST (Binary Evolution And Sentience Toolkit) is an open source project that defines and implements
a virtual machine with a custom instruction set. The virtual machine operates on a byte level and
supports all common low-level machine operations, but functions within an entirely virtual
environment. This allows users to experiment with code transformations and custom low-level
operators without the need for physical hardware.

One of the main goals of the BEAST project is to provide a platform for researchers and developers
to explore the intersection of evolution and computation. The virtual machine's custom instruction
set allows users to define their own low-level operators, enabling them to conduct experiments on
how these operators impact the evolution and optimization of binary code.

In addition to its use as a research platform, the BEAST virtual machine also has practical
applications in the field of computer science education. By providing a virtual environment for
students to learn about low-level machine operations and experiment with code transformations, the
BEAST project aims to give students a deeper understanding of how computers work at a fundamental
level.

The BEAST virtual machine is implemented in a high-level programming language, making it easily
accessible to a wide range of users. The project also includes extensive documentation and examples
to help users get started with the virtual machine and begin exploring its capabilities.

Overall, the BEAST project provides a powerful and flexible platform for researchers and educators
to explore the intersection of evolution and computation, and to gain a deeper understanding of
low-level machine operations. By providing a virtual environment for experimentation and education,
the BEAST project aims to advance the field of computer science and inspire the next generation of
developers and researchers.
