# BEAST - Binary Evolution And Sentience Toolkit

[![CircleCI badge](https://circleci.com/gh/dedicate-project/beast.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/dedicate-project/beast)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/dedicate-project/beast/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/dedicate-project/beast?branch=main)

This project defines and implements a virtual machine with a custom instruction set. It operates on byte level and supports all common low-level machine operations, but functions in an entirely virtual environment. This project does not build an x86 interpreter or anything alike, but makes available a custom byte-level machine language that can be used to experiment with code transformations and custom low-level operators.


## Building

First, install the dependencies (assuming you're working on a Ubuntu system):
```bash
sudo apt install clang-tidy ccache
```

To build the project, check out the source code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dedicate-project/beast/
cd beast
git submodule update
```

Then, inside the repository, perform the following actions to actually build the code:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

To run all tests, afterwards run:
```bash
make test
```

If you want to create a coverage report, install these additional dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install lcov npm
```

And run this:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
make coverage
```


## Adding a new Operator

To add a new operator, you need to follow these steps:

1. Add a new opcode in `include/beast/opcodes.hpp`: Append the new opcode with the next higher hex value at the end of the enum class `OpCode`.
1. Add a signature for this opcode in `include/beast/program.hpp`: This way, client programs can add the operator to a program.
1. Add the program implementation into `src/program.cpp`: This is the implementation of the signature you added in the previous step. Follow the example of existing operators, but in general: Use `appendCode1(...)` with the opcode you added in the first step, and then add any bytes you deem necessary for your operator.
1. Extend the `switch` in `src/cpu_virtual_machine.cpp` in the function `step()`: Add a case for your new opcode, read all parameters (no need to read the opcode, that's done automatically), print a `debug` statement with the operator signature, and call a `VmSession` function that matches your operator.
1. If there is no suitable `VmSession` function, define its signature in `include/beast/vm_session.hpp`: This is a function that explicitly accepts the parameters for your operator. See the existing ones for how to define them.
1. Implement the `VmSession` function you just defined in `src/vm_session.cpp`: Perform the actual logic that should be executed if the VM encounters your operator. Again, see existing operators for how to do it.
